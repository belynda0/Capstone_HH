### Hidden Homicides Project

This repository hosts the code, documentation, and resources for my capstone project, the **Hidden Homicides Project**, developed in collaboration with **Alliance for HOPE International**. The project aims to uncover patterns and insights within cold case files by using data-driven techniques to analyze and categorize cases, potentially identifying hidden homicides that may otherwise go unsolved.

Key components include:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Custom algorithm to classify cases as murder, suicide, or hidden homicide.
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth case analysis to pinpoint trends and triggers where cases become "cold."
- **Policy Review**: Exploration of legal and procedural factors that may impact case resolution.

All work adheres to strict confidentiality guidelines, with publicly available resources providing insight into methodologies without compromising sensitive information.
